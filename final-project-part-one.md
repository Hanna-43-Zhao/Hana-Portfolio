# Outline
For my final project, I will use publicly available data from the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) to analyze visitation trends across the national park system. Specifically, I want to explore patterns in visitor attendance, geographic distribution, and accessibility. My interest lies in uncovering how the popularity of different parks reflects broader aspects of American culture, geography, and infrastructure. By comparing highly visited destinations with lesser-known sites, I aim to highlight both the diversity of the park system and the behaviors of those who visit it.

This project is not only about presenting data, but also about telling a story: using visualization to show how national parks embody the diversity of natural and cultural landscapes in the United States, and how people interact with these spaces over time. I will highlight annual and monthly visitation patterns, regional contrasts, and seasonal peaks and lows, supported by case examples of representative parks. Since my intended audience is the general public, I will focus on clear explanations, intuitive comparisons, and narrative-driven visualizations that make the trends easy to understand and engaging to explore.



## Initial sketches
**Initial Sketch 1: Overall Trends**

Use line to show the overall trend of total visitation across all national parks (1980–2024).

**Initial Sketch 2: Visitors by Park**

Use line chart to show the annual visitation trends of all national parks and compare the differences between them.

**Initial Sketch 3: Visitors by Map**

Use circles of different sizes on a simplified U.S. map to show visitation, directly illustrating the geographic distribution of national parks. This visualization allows the audience to sense the contrast between parks in the East and the West, and to understand how population density and transportation access influence visitation levels.

I'm also thinking using different color to indicate the kind of National Park (landscape v.s. cultural) so audience know which is more popular, which more in east/west.

**Initial Sketch 4: Heatmap**

This heatmap showing simulated monthly visitation patterns across all 63 U.S. National Parks. The color intensity represents relative visitor numbers, higher values in summer months and lower values in winter. **This visualization was temporarily generated with ChatGPT, and it is only used here as a sketch to illustrate my idea for the project.**

# The data
In this project, I will use the Visitor Use Statistics dataset from the **U.S. National Park Service (NPS)**. It provides monthly and annual visitation numbers for all units in the National Park System, collected and standardized by the NPS Social Science Program. This dataset is comprehensive enough for my analysis.

To add context, I will also use climate data from the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**, including temperature and precipitation. This will help explain seasonal peaks and valleys at specifical parks. By combining visitation and climate data, I can give a clearer picture of seasonal patterns and offer practical insights for visitors, such as which seasons are most popular and which times may be less ideal for a visit.

# Method and medium

For this project, I will use Tableau to create interactive visualizations such as line charts, maps, and heatmaps to highlight visitation trends over time, geography, and seasonality. These visualizations will then be integrated into a narrative webpage using Shorthand, combining text and visuals into a cohesive story. The final product will be a publicly accessible digital project that allows the audience to follow the storyline while also exploring the data interactively.
