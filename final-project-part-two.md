# Wireframes / storyboards

After receiving critical feedback, I realized that my first draft relied too heavily on numbers and charts without building a true narrative for the audience. The story was fragmented, and I failed to transform the data into a persuasive call to action. This made the project feel more like a data report than a public-facing story.

In response, I rebuilt my storyboard to strengthen the storyline and focus on the economic and cultural importance of national parks. I organized the narrative into a clear sequence — from the pandemic impact, to budget cuts and staffing shortages, to the ripple effects on local economies and national heritage. I also added draft visualizations and paired them with case studies, quotes, and calls to action, connecting the data more directly to meaning and action, giving the audience both evidence and motivation to care.

# User research 

## Target Audience  

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals  
When defining the target audience, I considered both those directly impacted by national park funding and those with the power to influence change. I used a two-step method:  
- Stakeholder analysis: identifying groups whose lives, businesses, or decisions depend on national parks.  
- Persona sketches: creating representative individuals that reflect typical motivations, concerns, and behaviors within these groups.  

### Who I Hope to Reach  

1. **Everyday Visitors and Families**  
- Representative: A family from Ohio planning their summer trip to Yellowstone. They value affordable recreation and feel proud of experiencing America’s natural beauty.  
 - Motivation: Preserve access and quality of parks for their children and future generations.  
 - Desired Action: Support advocacy campaigns, donate, and share awareness.  

2. **Local Communities and Small Business Owners**  
 - Representative: A hotel owner in Estes Park, CO, whose livelihood depends on steady tourism from Rocky Mountain National Park.  
 - Motivation: Protect the economic engine of their community and ensure visitor services remain strong.  
 - Desired Action: Join advocacy coalitions, lobby elected officials, and partner with nonprofits or park foundations.  

3. **Policymakers and Decision Makers**  
 - Representative: A congressional staffer reviewing budget allocations for cultural and natural resources.  
 - Motivation: Respond to constituents’ pride in national parks while recognizing their local economic impact.  
 - Desired Action: Protect or increase national park funding in budgets and legislation.

## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is your first reaction after viewing the opening? | Found the image beautiful and engaging | Said the opening was strong and set a positive tone. | Thought it looked appealing, though the “problem” was not immediately obvious. |
| Does the introduction make you want to keep scrolling? | Yes, visuals kept attention. | Definitely, wanted to see more. | felt a bit like a report, but still continued. |
| Do the data visualizations help explain the problem, or are they confusing? | Overall clear, but wanted stronger links to real-world impacts. | Helpful, suggested use theme color in charts and maps. | Hope to see something more visually |
| Did any of the quotes, case studies, or images resonate with you personally? | Love the local businss story | Image is appealing and high-quality | Wanted more personal voices, such as park staff or visitors. |
| Did the story make sense overall? | Yes, though transitions could be smoother. | Flow was clear, liked the sequence from budget → economy → culture. | Mostly understandable, but wanted stronger proof of impact. |
| Were there any sections that felt disconnected? | Economic map felt slightly separate. | No, thought it was cohesive. | Cultural value section felt less integrated. |
| After seeing the story, do you feel more convinced that national parks deserve more funding? | Yes, especially after seeing preservation examples. | Yes, persuaded by the economic impact. | Yes, though wanted more direct evidence of negative effects. |
| Would you consider taking action ? | Yes, would share on social media. | Yes, especially if the CTA was more specific. | Interested, but needed a stronger call to action. |
| Was there anything you found unclear or overwhelming? | Some sections had too much text. | Charts needed clearer labeling. | Mix of charts and text felt a bit heavy. |
| What additional information, visuals, or stories would you like to see? | Before/after facility examples. | Stories from rangers or staff. | Maybe some stories about how NPs protect the local ecological system |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis (Findings / Observations) | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Opening visuals strong, but headline and intro not sharp enough to signal the problem clearly. | Revise headline to be more direct about funding challenges; clarify in the introduction why this issue matters immediately. |
| Charts were helpful but some felt too few or disconnected from real-world consequences. | Add more visualizations (e.g., staff numbers over time, maintenance backlog, education/volunteer program stats) and directly link them to impacts. |
| Logic between “budget cuts” and “negative impacts” was not fully convincing. | Strengthen causal chain by adding evidence. Provide concrete before/after examples. |
| Emotional resonance was uneven — local business and heritage stories worked, but participants wanted more human voices. | Incorporate ranger or volunteer perspectives, visitor quotes, and short human-centered anecdotes alongside data. |
| Narrative flow mostly clear but some transitions abrupt. | Smooth transitions between sections (budget → staffing → economy → cultural value) so the story arc feels seamless. |
| Call to action felt too general and weak. | Make CTA stronger and more specific, and show how individual actions make a difference. |
