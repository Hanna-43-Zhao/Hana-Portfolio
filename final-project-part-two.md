# Wireframes / storyboards

After receiving critical feedback, I realized that my first draft relied too heavily on numbers and charts without building a true narrative for the audience. The story was fragmented, and I failed to transform the data into a persuasive call to action. This made the project feel more like a data report than a public-facing story.

In response, I rebuilt my storyboard to strengthen the storyline and focus on the economic and cultural importance of national parks. I organized the narrative into a clear sequence — from the pandemic impact, to budget cuts and staffing shortages, to the ripple effects on local economies and national heritage. I also added draft visualizations and paired them with case studies, quotes, and calls to action, connecting the data more directly to meaning and action, giving the audience both evidence and motivation to care.

# User research 

## Target Audience  

### Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals  
When defining the target audience, I considered both those directly impacted by national park funding and those with the power to influence change. I used a two-step method:  
- Stakeholder analysis: identifying groups whose lives, businesses, or decisions depend on national parks.  
- Persona sketches: creating representative individuals that reflect typical motivations, concerns, and behaviors within these groups.  

### Who I Hope to Reach  

1. **Everyday Visitors and Families**  
- Representative: A family from Ohio planning their summer trip to Yellowstone. They value affordable recreation and feel proud of experiencing America’s natural beauty.  
 - Motivation: Preserve access and quality of parks for their children and future generations.  
 - Desired Action: Support advocacy campaigns, donate, and share awareness.  

2. **Local Communities and Small Business Owners**  
 - Representative: A hotel owner in Estes Park, CO, whose livelihood depends on steady tourism from Rocky Mountain National Park.  
 - Motivation: Protect the economic engine of their community and ensure visitor services remain strong.  
 - Desired Action: Join advocacy coalitions, lobby elected officials, and partner with nonprofits or park foundations.  

3. **Policymakers and Decision Makers**  
 - Representative: A congressional staffer reviewing budget allocations for cultural and natural resources.  
 - Motivation: Respond to constituents’ pride in national parks while recognizing their local economic impact.  
 - Desired Action: Protect or increase national park funding in budgets and legislation.
