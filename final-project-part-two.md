# Wireframes / storyboards

After receiving critical feedback, I realized that my first draft relied too heavily on numbers and charts without building a true narrative for the audience. The story was fragmented, and I failed to transform the data into a persuasive call to action. This made the project feel more like a data report than a public-facing story.

In response, I rebuilt my storyboard to strengthen the storyline and focus on the economic and cultural importance of national parks. I organized the narrative into a clear sequence â€” from the pandemic impact, to budget cuts and staffing shortages, to the ripple effects on local economies and national heritage. I also added draft visualizations and paired them with case studies, quotes, and calls to action, connecting the data more directly to meaning and action, giving the audience both evidence and motivation to care.
