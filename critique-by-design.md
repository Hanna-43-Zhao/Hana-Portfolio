# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

[Forbes: World’s Highest-Paid Athletes](https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/?sh=162054105b7e)
_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  
I selected this data visualization because the topic is interesting and highly engaging for a broad audience. The earnings of top athletes spark curiosity worldwide and connect to everyday conversations about sports, money, and fame. What's more, The source of the information which is forbes is also highly credible and widely recognized.

At the same time, while the dataset is rich in information and provides a comprehensive breakdown of athlete earnings, the original visualization is limited in how effectively it communicates insights. Table makes it harder for viewers to immediately see patterns across sports, countries, or the balance between on-field and off-field income. I think these shortcomings making it a strong candidate for redesign because there are many opportunities to highlight key stories, simplify comparisons, and make the data more visually impactful.

## Step two: the critique
### Strengths
- **Accuracy:** The source (Forbes) is reliable, and the dataset is transparen.
- **Completeness:** All the essential information is there.  
- **Clarity of facts:** As a lookup tool, it works well for quickly finding an athlete’s exact numbers.  

### Weaknesses
- **Low perceptibility and intuitiveness:** The table forces readers to scan row by row and mentally calculate comparisons. It doesn’t surface patterns or relationships automatically.  
- **Weak storytelling:** There is no visual guidance toward insights such as which sports dominate, which athletes rely most on commercial income, or how geography affects distribution.  
- **Limited engagement:** While useful as a database, it fails to spark curiosity or discussion because it looks flat and purely informational.  

### Overall Reflection
The visualization is useful as a reference but ineffective as a storytelling tool. Its plain design misses the opportunity to highlight trends, contrasts, or narratives that the data could reveal.  
A stronger design would shift the focus from raw numbers to meaningful insights, helping audiences understand not just who earned how much,but also why those patterns exist.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
